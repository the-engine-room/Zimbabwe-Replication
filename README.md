# Transparent Oil Namibia

The Transparent Oil Namibia platform maps the details, trends and connections in the allocation of Petroleum Exploration Licences in Namibia.

## Installing / Getting started

Requirements:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

```shell
git clone THIS-REPO.git
cd THIS-REPO
npm install
grunt
```

This will run localPHP server and live reload the browser when the files change. At this point your default browser will open [http://localhost:9011/](http://localhost:9011/).

### Building for production

```shell
grunt build
```

This will compile everything for production in the `dist` folder.


### Deploying / Publishing - TODO

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
